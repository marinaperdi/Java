<h1>Java Projects</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This repository features a series of Java programs that showcase different programming concepts, algorithms, and solutions to common problems.
<br />

<h3>Program 1</h3>
This Java program contains methods that manipulate arrays and ArrayLists by comparing string lengths. It includes functionality to count and return strings longer than the first string in the array, or longer than a specified length, along with JUnit test cases to validate the methods' accuracy in different scenarios.
<br />

<h3>Program 2</h3>
This Java program guides students through building and testing a CS252Point class and a Shape class using object-oriented programming principles. It involves writing multiple source files, using unit tests for verification, working with ArrayList, and practicing encapsulation, class interaction, and distance calculations between geometric points and shapes.
<br />

<h3>Program 3</h3>
This Java program demonstrates inheritance and object-oriented principles by modeling a company's organizational structure using Employee, Staff, and Manager classes. It includes functionality for assigning managers, calculating annual bonuses, and dynamically managing team member relationships through method calls and object references.
<br />

<h3>Program 4</h3>
This program is a JavaFX-based GUI application that allows users to input and validate U.S. state and license plate data, storing valid entries in an ArrayList. The application incorporates custom event handling, data validation based on state-specific formats, and object-oriented principles to manage user input and feedback interactively.
