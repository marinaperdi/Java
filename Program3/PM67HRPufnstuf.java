/* (a) Whatâ€™s the hardest part of this assignment for you? Please explain.
 * I think the hardest part was the overriding method toString() for manager and staff class. However, the pdf helped me a lot 
 * and I was able to complete it just fine. Also, the extra credit was kind of hard since I didn't know what tests I should have
 * done, and then I realized I needed a getter and I had to create it.
 * (b) Were you able to understand the relationships between classes in this assignment? How has your 
 * understanding of inheritance and composition changed by the end of this assignment?
 * Yes, at the beginning I didn't really understand it but then I realized what was going on and I completely understood the relationships.
 * I can say that my understanding of inheritance and composition has improved a lot after this assignment, it helped me understand the
 * concepts better and it was very good practice for the Exam2.
